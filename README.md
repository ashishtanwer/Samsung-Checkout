Problem:
Design and implement an Android application which maintains device inventory and allows user to order the devices:

·  On first launch, application should load XML with the attached schema (Inventory.xsd). XML will be present on SDCARD. Sample XML is attached (Inventory.xml).

·  On subsequent launch, Application should present the current devices (spec) and inventory details. Honoring and keeping orders already placed on another time.

·  User can place an order for multiple devices (Add to Cart). Once device is ordered, the inventory should be adjusted accordingly.

·  Order receipt should indicate device, quantity and total cost.

·  User can view his order history anytime.

·  (Optional) User can add more devices by loading another inventory.xml which will combine and update current inventory.

·  (Optional) User can export the current inventory to XML on SDCARD (attached schema). The XML should be named Inventory_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.xml

 

Expected deliverables:

·  Class diagram/ High level design

·  Android source code

·  APK and Screenshots

·  Assumptions made (if any)
